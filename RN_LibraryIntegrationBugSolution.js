To fix this, you need to carefully examine your project's setup and dependencies. 1. **Verify Library Compatibility:** Ensure the library you're using is explicitly compatible with React Native and not just a web-based library. 2. **Check Dependencies:** Carefully review your `package.json` and verify that all required dependencies for the problematic library are installed and correctly linked. 3. **Native Modules:** If the library interacts with native modules (Android or iOS), ensure you have followed the correct installation instructions and properly linked the native code in your project. 4. **Link Libraries:** For libraries requiring manual linking (less common now), use the appropriate commands for your platform to establish the necessary connections between your native and JavaScript code.  5. **Check for Conflicts:** If using multiple libraries that might conflict, use dependency management tools and resolve version conflicts to ensure compatibility. 6. **Clean and Rebuild:** After making changes to dependencies, clean and rebuild your project to apply changes properly. Example of better library integration:
```javascript
// Correct import statement if using a library designed for React Native
import MyReactNativeComponent from 'react-native-my-library';

// ... rest of your component
```
