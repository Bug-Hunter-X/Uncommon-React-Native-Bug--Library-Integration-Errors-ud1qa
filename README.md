This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked bug in React Native development: errors stemming from improper library integration or unmet dependencies. The bug showcases how attempting to use components designed for a different environment (web React) or those with missing dependencies within a React Native project can lead to cryptic errors or crashes. The solution provides a corrected approach to properly integrate the library and resolve the issue. This bug is uncommon due to its subtle nature and the lack of immediately obvious error messages, often requiring in-depth debugging and dependency analysis.
